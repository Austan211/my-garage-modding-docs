## My Garage unofficial modding docs

This is an unofficial modding guide and documentation for mod developers (and people who are interested in learning how to create mods) of My Garage.

Please note that if you don't have knowledge about C# or Unity this is not your place to start, this is intended for people who already know the basics of C# and Unity. If you are looking forward on learning these the Unity Documentation is a good place to start. Do some small projects like building some 3D unity games so you learn all the basics of the engine, components, what are GameObjects, MonoBehaviour, etc.

Also remember that most of your questions can be answered using Google!

## Here you will find:
* First steps, setting up all the basic things for doing mods.
* Small guide for using dnSpy for game's code reverse engineering and AssetBundle for decompiling game's assets.
* How to add your custom models into the game (AssetBundles).
* Explanations of the game's internals.

If you find any issue or want to suggest some content to be added you can open an issue in [GitHub](https://github.com/FedeArre/my-garage-modding-docs/issues)

* mbdriver for answering all the questions i had about the game's code (and also developing the game i guess).
