<h1 class="white" >Car grip system</h1>

The grip of a surface is determined by the tag of the GameObject that the wheel is currently above. There are three types:

- Road: The default grip for the wheel, used in all roads in the game.
- DirtRoad: The terrain and all the dirt roads in the game uses this tag. Also the car gets dirty while going in this road type.
- TRACK: Used in the floor of the garage (the whole floor where the garage and the barn are located) and the drift track. It is more slippery than dirt and normal roads.

For using these you only need to set the tag of your GameObject to the grip level that you want (Road, DirtRoad or TRACK).
